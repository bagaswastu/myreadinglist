After reading this, dare I ask what other horrors she has created? This dystopian horror story is set in a world that feels so close to our own, except a zoonotic virus has made it so that all animals have had to be destroyed. To fill the gap in the meat market, people start to breed and farm humans for their meat.\n             \n \n            It is as horrifying and gory as it sounds. Extra warning for those sensitive to scenes of sexual assault and animal cruelty. But while it is hard to stomach at times, I was morbidly fascinated by what Bazterrica had to say about the way humans take advantage of other humans because they can get away with it. The book is horribly convincing and believable. We only have to look to our own real world to recall the excuses humans have made to enslave other humans and to shuttle them off to extermination camps. It does not take a huge suspension of disbelief to imagine the events of this book could happen.\n             \n \n            The book also focuses on the way language is used to make humans feel better about committing atrocities. No one is allowed to say \"cannibalism\" and the meat in the book is packaged as \"special meat\". There's some dark humour, too, with a few prods at the hypocrisy of humans being outraged by slavery at the same time as imprisoning and eating other humans.\n             \n \n            It is told in third person limited and follows Marcos Tejo who works at a meat plant. He takes us through all the horrors involved with breeding, killing, flaying and packaging humans, whilst also dealing with the loss of his own infant son.\n             \n \n            For such a bleak tale, it is surprisingly compelling. All the time while reading I was wondering what on earth the conclusion of this nightmare could leave us with, but I think it was even more effective than I could have imagined.\n           ", "date_read": "2021-11-29T00:00:00", "date_added": "2021-11-23T00:00:00"}, {"id": "53745997", "cover": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1623940893l/53745997.jpg", "title": "Blood Scion (Blood Scion, #1)", "author": "\n            Falaye, Deborah\n           ", "rating": 0, "review": "\n            None\n           ", "date_read": null, "date_added": "2021-11-21T00:00:00"}, {"id": "58932365", "cover": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1637001677l/58932365.jpg", "title": "Yonder", "author": "\n            Standish, Ali\n           ", "rating": 0, "review": "\n            None\n           ", "date_read": null, "date_added": "2021-11-20T00:00:00"}, {"id": "54493401", "cover": "https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597695864l/54493401.jpg", "title": "Project Hail Mary", "author": "\n            Weir, Andy\n           ", "rating": 4, "review": "\n \n \n              I think my job is to solve the Petrova problem.\n               \n              \u2026in a small lab, wearing a bedsheet toga, with no idea who I am, and no help other than a mindless computer and two mummified roommates.\n              \n \n \n            Guess I was wrong to resist reading this for months.

And\n             \n             Project Hail Mary\n             \n            was so much fun. And science-y. And a bit sad.

The stakes in the novel feel immense, the chance of coming up with a plan and getting out of the central predicament seems tiny, and all of this science drama is juxtaposed with the narrative voice-- basically, a funny, can't-help-but-love-him nerd who manages to put his brain to work in the direst of circumstances.\n             \n \n            We begin with Ryland Grace waking up on a spaceship with no idea who he is and how he got there. Exploring his surroundings, he quickly discovers that his crew mates are dead and he is humanity's last hope for survival. I won't reveal his mission because I think learning about it through flashbacks is part of the fun, and the more we learn the more impossible his mission seems.\n             \n \n            I'll leave it at that. The book alternates between the past in the run up to the mission as we discover the huge problem humanity faces, and the present in which Ryland Grace attempts to save our planet. The world of the novel gets bigger and wilder and I have to say I very much enjoyed the adventure and mystery.\n             \n \n            It's not five stars for me because I felt it ran on a little long in the middle with the characters having one nerdgasm after another (which seems to be a thing with Weir) and I also saw the \"twist\" coming, if you can call it that\n             \n             (view spoiler)\n             \n \n             [the one about what Stratt did\n              \n              (hide spoiler)\n              \n             ]\n             \n            .
