Jane Austen called this brilliant work \"her own darling child\" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, \"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England.\n\n           ", "genres": ["\n              Classics\n             ", "\n              Fiction\n             ", "\n              Romance\n             ", "\n              Historical\n             ", "\n              Historical Fiction\n             ", "\n              Literature\n             ", "\n              Historical\n             ", "\n              Novels\n             ", "\n              Romance\n             ", "\n              Historical Romance\n             ", "\n              Audiobook\n             ", "\n              Adult\n             "], "pages": 279}
